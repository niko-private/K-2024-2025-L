# Cryptography Lab Works (2024/25)

This repository contains my cryptography lab works for the 2024/25 semester. Each lab covers different cryptographic concepts and implementations.

## Lab List

### Lab 1 - Frequency Analysis App
This lab focuses on frequency analysis but also has the ability to generate a Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher.  
It allows users to enter letters, swap them to find the cipher, and includes a word search tool for finding Macedonian words using regular expressions.
